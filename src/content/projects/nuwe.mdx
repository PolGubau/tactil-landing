# NUWE: A Design Odyssey

## Overview:

NUWE is a gamification company revolutionizing the hiring process for developers. I had the luck to be part as the company with my role as a **graphic designer**, shaping the visual identity of NUWE through a spectrum of creative endeavors.

## The Voyage:

From May 2, 2021, to January 3, 2023, NUWE became more than just a workplace—it became a **canvas for creativity and innovation**. As a graphic designer, my mission extended beyond traditional design tasks; I was entrusted with capturing the essence of NUWE's vision through captivating visuals as **Social Media**, **Rollups**, **Web Design**, **UX/UI**...

## Creative Arsenal:

1. **Photoshop:** The go-to tool for crafting intricate designs and refining visual elements, Photoshop played a pivotal role in creating eye-catching graphics for NUWE's various platforms.

2. **Figma:** Collaborative design found its home in Figma, where the entire team could seamlessly contribute to the creative process, fostering a dynamic and iterative design workflow.

3. **Illustrator:** Precision and scalability were achieved through Illustrator, ensuring that every detail in NUWE's visual elements translated seamlessly across diverse mediums.

4. **Adobe XD:** Bringing interactive prototypes to life, Adobe XD facilitated the design of engaging user interfaces, elevating the overall user experience in NUWE's gamification platform.

## The Essence of NUWE:

At NUWE, I delved into the realm of gamification applied to hiring developers. Beyond traditional design tasks, I sculpted the visual identity of NUWE across social networks and rollups. From conceptualizing ideas to translating them into visually appealing assets, every design resonated with the spirit of innovation and creativity ingrained in NUWE's mission.

## Team Synergy:

Collaboration was one of the pilars of NUWE. Working in tandem with other departments as the communication one was perfect to have a new profesional experience. I visually encapsulated the ideas of my colleagues, creating a cohesive narrative that echoed NUWE's commitment to innovation.

## International Colaborations:

Being the major designer of the company, I had the opportunity to collaborate with international companies like **Zurich Insurance**, **Accenture**, **Danone**, **CaixaBank**, **Binance**, **Oracle**, **Terrassa's townhall**, etc. creating social media posts, rollups, and other designs.

That aspect was incredibly inspirational and rewarding, as it allowed me to know new people, enterprises and their design system.

I had been in contiuous contact with these companies, and I had to adapt to their design system, and their needs, and that was a really good experience to **learn how to work with other giant companies**.
