# Pol/Games - A Journey into Singleplayer Minigames

## Introduction

As a web developer, videogames has always been an interesting tpe of media but not my focus point.
As a design and code showcase and a way to master React, I decided to create a collection of singleplayer minigames.
This led to the birth of **Pol/Games**, a collection designed to provide users with a delightful experience in the form of games that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also intellectually stimulating.

### The Concept

The primary focus of Pol/Games is to offer a diverse set of minigames. Currently, it features two games:

- a word-per-minute challenge
- a memory game.

These games are just the beginning, as I have plans for expanding the collection with more captivating games in the future.

## Word-Per-Minute Challenge ‚å®Ô∏è

The word-per-minute game is designed to test and improve your typing speed and accuracy. It provides a fun and interactive way to enhance your typing skills while enjoying the game.

    src={phoneMockup}
  />
 
</div>

## Memory Game üü®

The memory game, on the other hand, exercises your cognitive abilities. It challenges your memory by presenting patterns or sequences that you need to remember and reproduce, adding an element of strategy to the gaming experience.

## Future Plans

The journey of Pol/Games doesn't end here. I am committed to continuously evolving and expanding the collection. Future updates may include new games, enhanced features, and an even more immersive gaming experience.
