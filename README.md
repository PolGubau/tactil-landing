# Táctil – Web & Digital Design Studio

Welcome to the codebase of **Táctil**, our official landing page and portfolio.
Táctil is a creative studio offering **custom design and development** for ambitious brands seeking **fast**, **scalable**, and **unique** digital experiences. Our work aims to break away from the world of generic templates—because **templates are for slideshows, not your website**.

---

## ✨ Vision

Modern websites often fall into two extremes: overdesigned yet underperforming templates, or fast but visually soulless themes. At Táctil, we bridge that gap by delivering handcrafted interfaces, subtle interactions, and performant codebases—all tailored to the brand’s DNA.

We build websites that:

* Convert better by being intentional
* Scale with your business
* Load blazingly fast
* Feel alive thanks to motion and detail

Our tagline sums it up:

> "Custom **design & development** for ambitious brands.
> Fast🚀, unique🦄 and scalable📈 digital experiences."

## 🧠 Why Astro?

The web doesn’t need more megabytes of JS just to render static content.

We use **[Astro](https://astro.build)** as our foundation to keep shipping:

* **Zero-JS by default**, great for landing pages and SEO
* **Island architecture**, enabling selective interactivity
* **Fast build times** and optimizations out-of-the-box

Combined with **React Islands** and **TailwindCSS**, Astro gives us the power to deliver real-time performance *and* expressive interfaces.

## 🌍 i18n & Translations

The website is built with internationalization in mind. Text content is abstracted into language-specific files (`en.ts`, etc). Here's a preview of our English content:

```ts
{
  title: "Templates are for slideshows.",
  subtitle: "Not your website.",
  summary: "Custom <strong>design & development</strong> for ambitious brands.<br>Fast🚀, unique🦄 and scalable📈 digital experiences.",
  getInTouch: "Get in touch",
  ticketTitle: "Building a great site <strong>is hard</strong>",
  ticketSubtitle: "Burning money and time on websites that don't work <strong>is harder</strong>",
  ticketFooter: "Identified? That's where we step in"
}
```

This allows easy expansion to other locales and supports dynamic UI rendering per language.
